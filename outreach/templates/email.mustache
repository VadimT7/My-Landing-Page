Subject: Had an idea for {{brand}}

Hey {{firstName}},

I came across {{brand}} and your fleet instantly stood out—seriously impressive lineup.

I've worked with other premium rental brands, and your aesthetic gave me a clear vision of what your site *should* look like.

So I started designing something specifically around your brand: high-end layout, full mobile experience, booking-ready. If you're open to it, I can finish putting it together and send a private preview. No strings.

Would that be something worth seeing?
